The primary dataset utilized in this project is the BETH Dataset, which focuses on botnet detection within IoT environments.

The version of the BETH dataset used here was obtained from DataCamp. Only a truncated version of the preprocessed BETH dataset is included in this directory. This truncated dataset is sufficient for demonstration, testing, and verifying the project's code structure and functionality.

The full BETH dataset (as provided by DataCamp after their preprocessing) is not included here.

#### _Note on preprocessing_
It's important to note that most of the initial preprocessing, feature engineering, and cleaning of the raw BETH data was already performed by DataCamp.
The data provided by DataCamp is in a format suitable for direct model training, reducing the need for extensive initial data preparation.
